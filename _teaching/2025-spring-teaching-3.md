The data structure is a data organization and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.

[The slides](/files/2025_1_DS/0226_DS_chapter1.pptx) for basic overview and [algorithm analysis](/files/2025_1_DS/0226_DS_chapter_algorithmAnalysis.pdf) at Feb 26 and 27.

[This slides](/files/2025_1_DS/0227_DS_Linear.pptx) for linear list including sequence list and queue list, [this slides](/files/2025_1_DS/0305_DS_Linear2.ppt) for linked list. The textbook problems code [1](/files/2025_1_DS/code/problem2_1.c), [2](/files/2025_1_DS/code/problem2_2.c), [3](/files/2025_1_DS/code/problem2_3.c), [4](/files/2025_1_DS/code/problem2_4.c), [5](/files/2025_1_DS/code/problem2_5.c), [6](/files/2025_1_DS/code/problem2_6.c), [7](/files/2025_1_DS/code/problem2_7.c), [8](/files/2025_1_DS/code/problem2_8.c), [9](/files/2025_1_DS/code/problem2_9.c) and [10](/files/2025_1_DS/code/problem2_10.c). A online C language demonstrates [platform](https://www.jyshare.com/compile/11/).

[This slides](/files/2025_1_DS/0305_DS_StackQueue.ppt) for stack and queue on March 6, 12 and 13.

[The slides](/files/2025_1_DS/0319_DS_StringArrayGList.pptx) for string, array and generalized list on March 19, 20, 26 and 27. With code for [string structures](/files/2025_1_DS/code/0327_stringArrChart.c) and [matrix](/files/2025_1_DS/code/0327_matrix.c), and also about [problem](/files/2025_1_DS/0327_DS_Practice.pptx) page 109.

Based on the linear data structure experiment at april 1, the [operation problem](/files/2025_1_DS/0401_DS_ExperimentLinear1.docx) should be completed during class time and  be submitted in the nearest class. [The experiment report format](/files/2025_1_DS/0401_DS_ExperimentModule.docx) must like that.
 
[The slides](/files/2025_1_Ds/0402_DS_Tree.pptx) for tree structures, array and generalized list at April 2 and 3. [Practices](/files/2025_1_DS/0403_DS_Practice_binaryTree.pptx)

Based on the stark and queue data structure experiment at april 8, the [operation problem](/files/2025_1_DS/0408_DS_ExperimentStark.docx) using C language should be completed during class time and also be submitted in the nearest class.
