Based on Wiki, artificial Intelligence（AI）aims to simulate or create intelligence for the general problem into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. Except the textbook, there are several books as the references for making up the detail, such as [artificial intelligence lecture](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~linghe.kong/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E8%AE%B2%E4%B9%89%E5%86%AF%E7%BF%94.pdf), [artificial intelligence
a modern approach, fourth edition](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf). A online neural network [example](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.57497&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) showing how the data work inside the model.
